# Twst Story Reader
Inspired by [050644zf's ArknightsStoryTextReader](https://github.com/050644zf/ArknightsStoryTextReader), but shares little to no code with it, as I primarily made this myself after teaching myself the basics of Python in 5 or so hours.

To use, place the .JSON files you want parsed inside an "inputs" directory, and then run in the command line:

`python reader.py`

**If a file is *not* properly formatted as a JSON file, this code will not work!**

## Known issues
- Doesn't account for pathing or choices
- May miss certain types of flavor text
- Output could use some retooling in formatting
